    <h1>Task 1</h1>

    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
    <p>
        Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2>
    <p><em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Cupufet, ormed with swurds anu bucklers</em></p>
    <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <h2>GREGORY</h2>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>

    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>)</b> is the standard markup
        language for creating web pages and web<br> applications.</p>

    <p>
        Web browsers receive <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents<br>into multimedia web pages. <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> describes the structure of a web
        page semantically and originally<br>included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages.With <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, constructs, images and other objects<br> such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        provides a means to create<br> structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings,paragraphs, lists, links,<br> quotes and other items.
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
        brackets. Tags such as<br>
        <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other
        tagssuch as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and<br>
        provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not<br>
        display the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags, but use them to interpret the content of
        the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup consists of several key components, including those
        called tags (and their <i>attributes</i>),<br>
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, tags most commonly come in<br>
        pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so
        are unpaired, for example<br>
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are
        also called
        <i>opening<br> tags</i> and <i>closing tags</i>).
    </p>

    <p>
        Another important component is the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document type
        declaration, which triggers standards mode<br> rendering.
    </p>

    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
        &lt;html&gt; <br>
        &lt;head&gt; <br>
        &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt; <br>
        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
        &lt;body&gt; <br>
        &lt;p&gt;Hello worldl&lt;/p&gt; <br>
        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
        <br>
        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
    </code>
